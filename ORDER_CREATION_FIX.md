# Order Creation Fix - "Unknown Error" Issue

## Problem
Order was being created successfully in the database (orderId: 6), but the frontend was receiving an "Unknown error" message.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by **JSON serialization problems** when returning the full `Order` object in the response. The `Order` object has circular references:
- `Order` → `User` → `Account` (with `passwordHash`)
- `Order` → `Event` (with various nested objects)
- `Order` → `TicketType` (with event reference)

Even with `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotations, the serialization could fail or produce incomplete results, leading to the "Unknown error" message on the frontend.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Response in OrderController
**File**: `src/main/java/com/group02/openevent/controller/OrderController.java`

Changed from returning the full `Order` object to a simplified response:
```java
// OLD (could cause JSON serialization issues):
return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of(
    "success", true, 
    "orderId", order.getOrderId(),
    "order", order  // Full object with circular references
));

// NEW (safe and clean):
Map<String, Object> response = Map.of(
    "success", true, 
    "orderId", order.getOrderId(),
    "totalAmount", order.getTotalAmount(),
    "status", order.getStatus().toString()
);
return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging at each step of order creation
- Improved error messages to include exception class name if message is null
- Added try-catch with stack trace printing

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
Added logging in both `OrderController` and `OrderServiceImpl` to trace the exact flow:

**OrderController logging:**
- Request received
- Account ID validation
- User ID validation
- Order creation status
- Response being sent

**OrderServiceImpl logging:**
- Event validation
- Ticket type validation
- Ticket availability check
- Ticket reservation
- Order object creation
- Total amount calculation
- Database save operation

## How to Test

1. **Access the test page**: http://localhost:8080/test_payment_flow.html

2. **Follow the steps in order**:
   - Step 1: Check Authentication
   - Step 2: Login with test credentials
   - Step 5: Check User Data (ensure user record exists)
   - Step 6: Create Order (this should now work without "Unknown error")
   - Step 7: Create Payment

3. **Check the console logs** in your IDE/terminal to see the detailed flow

## Expected Output

### Success Response (simplified):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "orderId": 7,
  "totalAmount": 100000,
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

### Error Response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Specific error message here"
}
```

## Console Logs to Expect
```
=== Order Creation Request ===
Request: CreateOrderWithTicketTypeRequest{...}
Account ID: 8
User ID: 6
Creating order...
=== OrderServiceImpl.createOrderWithTicketTypes ===
User ID: 6
Event ID: 1
Step 1: Validating event...
Event found: Sample Event Title
Step 2: Validating ticket type ID: 1
Ticket type found: VIP, Price: 100000
Step 3: Checking ticket availability...
Ticket available for purchase
Step 4: Reserving tickets...
Tickets reserved successfully
Step 5: Creating order object...
Step 6: Calculating total amount...
Total amount: 100000
Step 7: Saving order to database...
Order saved successfully with ID: 7
=== Order Creation Complete ===
Order created successfully. Order ID: 7
Sending response: {success=true, orderId=7, totalAmount=100000, status=PENDING}
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the order creation flow with the test page
2. If successful, remove the debug `System.out.println` statements
3. Consider using a proper logging framework (SLF4J/Logback) instead of System.out
